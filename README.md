# My first smart contract

This is the start of my journey into the world of blockchains. 
This is a basic contract, a basic getter/setter for a message.
I am using solidity compiler to compile the code and to get the bytecode.
Using Ganache-CLI to create a private ethereum blockchain to run tests.
Using truffle wallet provider and web3.
Also, i have written some test scripts using mocha.
Used the Rinkeby test network for all my tests.
